Jaxl v3.x (A work in progress):
--------------------------------
Jaxl v3.x is a successor of v2.x (and is NOT backward compatible), 
carrying a lot of code from v2.x while throwing away the redundant part.
Several components have been re-written keeping in my mind feedback from
the developer community over the last 4 years.

Jaxl v3.x is an object oriented XMPP client and component library

Design:
-------
Following folders can be found inside JAXL project directory:

/xmpp       contains generic xmpp rfc and other components
/xep        contains various xmpp xep implementation
/core       contains generic framework components
/tests      test suite
/examples   a bunch of working examples
/jaxl.php   api file (that needs to be included by examples/app files)

With v3.x, every thing is mapped into an object:

XMPPStream		abstract xmpp stream
XMPPIq			xmpp iq stanza object
XMPPMsg			xmpp msg stanza object
XMPPPres		xmpp pres stanza object
XMPPStanza		any xmpp stanza object
XMPPXep			abstract xmpp extension
XMPPJid			xmpp jid object
JAXLEvent		generic event registry and execution class
JAXLSocket		generic socket level operations
JAXLXmlStream	generic SAX style XML parser
JAXLXml			generic XML object implementation

XMPPStream is an abstract class and implement core xmpp rfc. It utilizes 
JAXLXmlStream for SAX-style XML parsing and JAXLSocket for socket operations.

JAXL class extends abstract XMPPStream class to add XMPP-IM functionalities
on top of the base xmpp stream. JAXLEvent is also used to provide an event based
framework on top of underlying xmpp stream.
