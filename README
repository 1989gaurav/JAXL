Jaxl v3.x (A work in progress):
--------------------------------
Jaxl v3.x is a successor of v2.x (and is NOT backward compatible), 
carrying a lot of code from v2.x while throwing away the redundant part.
Several components have been re-written keeping in my mind feedback from
the developer community over the last 4 years.

Jaxl v3.x is an object oriented XMPP client and component library

Structure:
----------
Following folders can be found inside JAXL project directory:

/xmpp       contains generic xmpp rfc and other components
/xep        contains various xmpp xep implementation
/core       contains generic framework components
/tests      test suite
/examples   a bunch of working examples
/jaxl.php   api file

With v3.x, every thing is mapped into an object:

JAXLEvent       generic event registry and execution class
JAXLSocket      generic socket level operations
JAXLXmlStream   generic SAX style XML parser
JAXLXml         generic XML object implementation
XMPPStream      abstract xmpp stream
XMPPIq          xmpp iq stanza object
XMPPMsg         xmpp msg stanza object
XMPPPres        xmpp pres stanza object
XMPPStanza      any xmpp stanza object
XMPPXep         abstract xmpp extension
XMPPJid         xmpp jid object

Working:
--------
1) include jaxl.php and initialize a new JAXL object
2) depending upon configuration array, JAXL will decide on what transport to use for xmpp stream
   if bosh_url config param is passed, XEP_0206 is used as transport instead of JAXLSocket
3) underlying xmpp stream uses configured transport for all send/recv of xmpp stanza's
