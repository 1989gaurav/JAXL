In last 1 year, Jaxl was downloaded 3,000 times, more than any other XMPP client library in PHP
However, Jaxl 1.x release lacked developer API support
In order to have a better support from the developer community, library has been restructured in 2.x release
Also the hosting moves from google code to github
